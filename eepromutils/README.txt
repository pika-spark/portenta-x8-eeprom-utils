Utilities to create, flash and dump HAT EEPROM images.

COMING SOON!

Tools will be appearing very shortly - in the meantime if people want
to ship boards, please use a blank EEPROM but make sure it can be un-
write protected by a user (e.g. via a board jumper) so that it can be
flashed in future once this stuff is all working.

Follow the ID EEPROM section in the HAT design guide and we recommend a
32kbit EEPROM which should be ample for future images.
